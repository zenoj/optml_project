# Comparing the MoTEF Federated Learning Algorithm to SOTA
In this course work project we will benchmark the [MoTEF algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20114) 
proposed by Islamov et al. and compare the measurements with another state of the art federated learning 
algorithms BEER (https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~yuejiec/papers/BEER.pdf).
